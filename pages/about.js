            <h1>Hi!  I'm Nick</h1>
            <h3>I am a software developer, a husband, and a dad.  </h3>
            <h3>I am passionate about helping people, and I love being able to use my talents to improve the lives of those around me.</h3>
            <h3>I have a background in the medical field where I was going to school to be a nurse until an injury made that career path not possible anymore.</h3>
            <h3>More recently, I was a quality assurance technician at an aerospace manufaturing company.</h3>
            <h3>I have always had an eye for finding errors. Whether it's a movie scene with a minor plot hole, or an article with the wrong their/there/they're, I am quick to point out these kinds of things.  You might read this and think that I'm a glass half empty person, only seeing the bad in things...but I am the opposite. I see every error as an opportunity to make things better. </h3>
            <h3>After taking a few free coding courses online, I knew I was hooked and had to learn more. Coding is the perfect balance between problem solving when bugs occur, and being creative and inventive.  I have grown very passionate about it, and I am excited to use this new skill to impact the lives of others.  </h3>
